# stuff_witth_tensorflow
This contains my work on tensorflow and partition among Pi and Desktop.

Install dependencies like tensorflow and kearas if possible.

Run learning_model.py first. This will train and save the model.

Run run_on_desktop_first.py first. This will run first and will wait for data from run_on_pi, so run_on_pi.py after.

Need to do some changes on run_on_desktop_first.py, if both the files are run on the same machine.
